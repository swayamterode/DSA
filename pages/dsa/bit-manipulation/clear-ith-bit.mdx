# Clear the K-th Bit

Given a number `n` and an integer `i`, clear the `K`th bit of `n`. Meaning, set the `K`th bit of `n` to `0`.

**Example**

```bash
Input: n = 5, K = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: 5 in binary is 101.
Clearing the 2nd bit will result in 001 which is 1 in decimal.
```

## Approach

1. We know how to set the bit `k-th` position, with the help left shift and OR operator.
2. Now we can do ~(i \<\< k) and then AND it with n to clear the `k-th` bit.

<Callout emoji = "❤️‍🔥">
So the formula to clear the `k-th` bit is: N & (~(1 \<\< K))
</Callout>

## Code

```cpp copy showLineNumbers filename="clear-kth-bit.cpp"

int clearKthBit(int n, int k) {
    return n & (~(1 << k));
}
```

## Dry Run

Let's dry run the code with the given example:

```bash
n = 5, K = 2
```

1. `n` in binary is `101`.
2. `1 << K` will be `1 << 2` which is `100`.
3. `~(1 << K)` will be `~100` which is `011`.
   - `~100` is `011` because `~1` is `0` and `~0` is `1` [(Not operator)](../bit-manipulation/introduction#bitwise-not-operator-).
4. `n & (~(1 << K))` will be `101 & 011` which is `001`.
5. `001` in decimal is `1`.

So, the output is `1`.
