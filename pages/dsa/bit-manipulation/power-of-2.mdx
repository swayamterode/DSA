# Check if the number is power of two

Given an Number `N`, Write a program to check if `N` is a `power of 2`.

## Approach

Every power of 2 will have only `one` bit set in it! So, we can use this property to solve this problem.

**Example:**

```bash
N = 16
16 = `10000` in binary
```

As we can see, there is only one set bit in the binary representation of 16. So, 16 is a power of 2.

When we do `N & (N-1)` this will be depicted as follows:

```bash
16 = 10000
15 = 01111

  10000
& 01111
  ------
  00000
```

So, if the result of `N & (N-1)` is 0, then the number is a **power of 2**.

## Dry run

Let's take an example to check if `N = 16` is a power of 2 or not.

```bash
N = 16
16 = 10000
15 = 01111

  10000
& 01111
  ------
  00000
```

## Code

```cpp showLineNumbers copy
boll powerOfTwo(int N) {
    if(N & (N-1) == 0) {
        return true; // return true if N is power of 2
    }
    return false; // else return false
}
```
