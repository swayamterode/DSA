# Check if the ith bit is set or not

Given a number `N` and a bit number `K`, check if the `Kth` bit of N is `set` or `not`. A bit is called set if it is `1`.

<Callout type="info">
  Note: Indexing starts with 0 from LSB (least significant bit) side in the
  binary representation of the number.
</Callout>

**Examples:**

```bash
Input: n = 5, k = 1
Output: NOT SET
Explanation: 5 is represented as 101 in binary and bit at position 1 is not set

Input: n = 2, k = 3
Output: NOT SET
Explanation: 2 is represented as 10 in binary, all higher i.e. beyond MSB, bits are NOT SET.
```

## Approach

### Left Shift Operator

The basic idea is to left shift the number by K bits and perform `&` with N

```bash showLineNumbers filename="./bit-manipulation/isKthBitSet.cpp"
bool isKthBitSet(int n, int k)
{
    if (n & (1 << k) != 0)
        return true;
    else
        return false;
}
```

### Dry Run

Let's dry run the above code with the following input:

```bash
n = 13, k = 2

n = 13 = 1101 (in binary)
```

<Steps>

### First computing `1 << k`

- `1 << 2` = `100` (in binary)

### Now, performing `&` operation

- `n & (1 << k)` = `1101 & 100`

```
  1101
& 0100
------
  0100
```

</Steps>

<Callout>
  Whenever we get a non-zero value, it means the `kth` bit is set.
</Callout>

The value of this is `4` which is non-zero, so the `kth` bit is set.

## Right Shift Operator

Another approach is to right shift the number by `k` bits and perform `&` with `1`

```bash showLineNumbers filename="./bit-manipulation/isKthBitSet.cpp"
bool isKthBitSet(int n, int k)
{
    if ((n >> k) & 1)
        return true;
    else
        return false;
}
```

### Dry Run

Let's dry run the above code with the following input:

```bash
n = 9, k = 2

n = 9 = 1001 (in binary)
```

<Steps>

### First computing `n >> k`

- `n >> 2` = `10` (in binary)

### Now, performing `&` operation

- `(n >> k) & 1` = `10 & 1`

```
  10
& 01
------
  00
```

</Steps>

<Callout>
  Whenever we get a non-zero value, it means the `kth` bit is set.
</Callout>

The value of this is `0` which is zero, so the `kth` bit is **not set**.
