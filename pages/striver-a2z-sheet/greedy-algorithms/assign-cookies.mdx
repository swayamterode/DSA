# Assign Cookies

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child `i` has a greed factor `g[i]`, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie `j` has a size `s[j]`. If `s[j] >= g[i]`, we can assign the cookie `j` to the child `i`, and the child `i` will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

**Example 1:**

```cpp
Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3.
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```cpp
Input: g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2.
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children,
You need to output 2.
```

Constraints:

- `1 <= g.length <= 3 * 104`
- `0 <= s.length <= 3 * 104`
- `1 <= g[i], s[j] <= 231 - 1`

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findContentChildren(vector<int>& g, vector<int>& s) {
        sort(s.begin(), s.end());
        sort(g.begin(), g.end());
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int n = g.size(), m = s.size();
        while(i < n && j < m) {
            if(s[j] >= g[i]) {
                j++;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return j;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

<Callout>
  The time complexity is `O(nlogn + mlogm)`, where `n` is the size of the `g`
  array and `m` is the size of the `s` array.
</Callout>

## Space Complexity

<Callout>The space complexity is `O(1)`.</Callout>
