# Introduction to Bit Manipulation

Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or binary digits.

### Convert Decimal to Binary

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>

<Steps>

### Divide the number by 2

### Keep track of the remainder

### Repeat the process until the number is 0 or 1

### Reverse the remainders

</Steps>

**Example:**

```bash
Decimal Number: 5 # Convert this number to binary
Binary Number: 101 # 5 in binary
```

</details>

### Convert Binary to Decimal

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>

<Steps>

### Multiply each bit by 2 raised to the power of its position

### Add the results

</Steps>

**Example:**

```bash

Binary Number: 101 # Convert this number to decimal
Decimal Number: 5 # 101 in decimal

# Calculation
1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 = 5
```

</details>

### 1's Complement

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>

<Steps>

### Convert the Decimal Number to Binary Number

### Now just flip the bits

</Steps>

**Example:**

```bash
Decimal Number: 5 # Convert this number to 1's complement
Binary Number: 101 # 5 in binary
1's Complement: 010 # Flipped the bits
```

</details>

### 2's Complement

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>

<Steps>

### Convert the Decimal Number to Binary Number

### Now flip the bits

### Add 1 to the flipped bits

</Steps>

**Example:**

```bash
Decimal Number: 5 # Convert this number to 2's complement
Binary Number: 101 # 5 in binary
1's Complement: 010 # Flipped the bits
2's Complement: 011 # Added 1 to the flipped bits
```

</details>

### Bitwise AND Operator (&)

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>

This is the truth table for the bitwise AND operator

| A   | B   | A & B |
| --- | --- | ----- |
| 0   | 0   | 0     |
| 0   | 1   | 0     |
| 1   | 0   | 0     |
| 1   | 1   | 1     |

**Example:**

```bash
A = 5 # 101
B = 3 # 011

A & B = 1 # 001

# Calculation
101
011
---
001
```

<Callout>Trick to remember: 1 & 1 = 1, else 0</Callout>

</details>

### Bitwise OR Operator (|)

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>

This is the truth table for the bitwise OR operator

| A   | B   | A \| B |
| --- | --- | ------ |
| 0   | 0   | 0      |
| 0   | 1   | 1      |
| 1   | 0   | 1      |
| 1   | 1   | 1      |

**Example:**

```bash
A = 5 # 101
B = 3 # 011

A | B = 7 # 111

# Calculation
101
011
---
111
```

<Callout>Trick to remember: 0 | 0 = 0, else 1</Callout>

</details>

### Bitwise XOR Operator (^)

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>

This is the truth table for the bitwise XOR operator

| A   | B   | A ^ B |
| --- | --- | ----- |
| 0   | 0   | 0     |
| 0   | 1   | 1     |
| 1   | 0   | 1     |
| 1   | 1   | 0     |

Example:

```bash

A = 5 # 101
B = 3 # 011

A ^ B = 6 # 110

# Calculation
101
011
---
110

This is the binary representation of 6
```

<Callout>Trick to remember: `1 ^ 1 = 0`, `0 ^ 0 = 0`, else 1</Callout>

</details>

### Bitwise NOT Operator (~)

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>

This is the truth table for the bitwise NOT operator

| A   | ~A  |
| --- | --- |
| 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   |

Example:

```bash
A = 5 # 101
~A = -6 # 010

# Calculation
101
---
010

This is the binary representation of -6

How? 2's complement of 6 is 010

```

<Callout>Trick to remember: 1 becomes 0, 0 becomes 1</Callout>

### Left Shift Operator (\<\<)

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>
Left shift operator shifts the bits to the left by n positions

Example:

```bash
A = 5 # 101

A << 1 = 10 # 1010
```

</details>

### Right Shift Operator (\>\>)

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>

Right shift operator shifts the bits to the right by n positions

Example:

```bash

A = 5 # 101

A >> 1 = 2 # 10
```

</details>
