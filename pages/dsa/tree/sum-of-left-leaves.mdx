# 404. Sum of Left Leaves

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the sum of all left leaves.

A leaf is a node with no children. A left leaf is a leaf that is the left child of another node.

**Example 1:**

![Example 1](../../../public/images/sumOfLeftLeaves/question.svg)

```bash
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 24
Explanation: There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively.
```

**Example 2:**

```bash
Input: root = [1]
Output: 0
```

## Approach

<Steps>

### Base Case

If `root` is `NULL`, return immediately.

### Processing Left Leaf Nodes

- Check if `root` has a `left child` `(root->left != NULL)`.

  - **If the left child is a leaf** (both left and right are NULL), add its value to sum.

- Recursively call `sumOfLeftLeaves(root->left)` to process the left subtree.
- Recursively call `sumOfLeftLeaves(root->right)` to process the right subtree.

                    sum += root->left->val;
            }
            sumOfLeftLeaves(root->left);
            sumOfLeftLeaves(root->right);
