# Count the number of set bits

Given a number `N`, Write a program to count the number of set bits in `N`.

## Approach

Convert the given number to binary and count the number of set bits in the binary representation.

**Example:**

```bash
N = 5
5 = `101` in binary
```

As we can see, there are `2` set bits in the binary representation of 5. So, the output will be `2`.

## Code

```cpp showLineNumbers copy
int countSetBits(int N) {
    int count = 0;
    while(N) {
        count += N & 1; // check if the last bit is set
        N >>= 1; // right shift the number
    }
    return count;
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

<Callout>Time Complement: O(log N) | Space Complexity: O(1)</Callout>

Why O(log N) time complexity?

- The right shift works as a division by 2. So, the time complexity will be O(log N).
