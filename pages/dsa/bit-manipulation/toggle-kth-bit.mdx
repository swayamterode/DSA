# Toggle k-th bit

For a given number n, if k-th bit is 0, then toggle it to 1 and if it is 1 then, toggle it to 0.

**Examples :**

```bash
Input : n = 5, k = 1
Output : 4
5 is represented as 101 in binary
and has its first bit 1, so toggling
it will result in 100 i.e. 4.

Input : n = 2, k = 3
Output : 6

Input : n = 75, k = 4
Output : 67
```

## Approach

1. We know how to convert number into binary.
2. Now inorder to toggle k-th bit, we need to `left shift` the number `1` by `k bits` and then `XOR` it with `N`

## Implementation

```cpp
int toggleKthBit(int N, int k) {
    return ( N ^ (1 << K)); // XOR with 1 left shifted by k bits
}
```

Confused? Let's dry run the above code with an example.

## Dry Run

**Example 1:**

Given `N = 13`, `k = 2`

```bash
N = 13 = 1101
1 << k = 1 << 2 =  100
```

Now, we will `XOR` the above two values

```bash filename="dry-run.txt"
👇
1101
0100
-----
1001
```

**Example 2:**

Given `N = 13`, `k` = 1.

```bash
N = 13 = 1101
1 << k = 1 << 1 =  10
```

<Callout emoji="❗">Here the kth is `0`, which is unset bit.</Callout>

```bash filename="dry-run.txt"
  1101
^ 0010
-------
  1111
```

The output is `14`.
