# Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element (we will call it a node) of a list is comprising of two items - the data and a reference to the next node. The last node has a reference to null. The entry point into a linked list is called the head of the list. It should be noted that the head is not a separate node, but the reference to the first node. If the list is empty then the head is a null reference.

## Advantages of Linked Lists

1. Dynamic size
2. Ease of insertion/deletion

## Disadvantages of Linked Lists

1. Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node.

## Types of Linked Lists

1. Singly Linked List
2. Doubly Linked List
3. Circular Linked List
4. Doubly Circular Linked List

## Creating a Linked List

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Node {
  public:
    int data;
    Node* next;

    Node(int data) {
      this->data = data;
      this->next = nullptr;
    }
};

int main()
{
  Node* newNode = new Node(4);

  cout<< newNode->data << endl; // 4
  cout<< newNode->next << endl; // 0

    return 0;
}
```
