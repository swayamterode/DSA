# Set the ith Bit

Given a number n and a value k. From the right, set the kth bit in the binary representation of n. The position of LSB(or last bit) is 0, second last bit is 1 and so on.

**Examples:**

```bash
Input : n = 10, k = 2
Output : 14
10 = 1010
Now, set the 2nd bit from right.
14 = 1110
2nd bit has been set.

Input : n = 15, k = 3
Output : 15
3rd bit of 15 is already set.
```

## Approach

The idea is to use bitwise OR operator (|) with the converted binary number by left shifting the number by k times!

## Implementation

```cpp filename="set_ith_bit.cpp" showLineNumbers
int setIthBit(int &n, int k) {
    return n = n | (i << k)
}
```

## Dry Run

Let's dry run the above implementation with the given example:

```bash
n = 10, k = 2
```

- Binary representation of 10 is `1010`
- Left Shift the number by k times: `1 << 2` = `100`
- Perform bitwise OR operation: `1010 | 100`

```
  1010
| 0100
-------
  1110
```

- Return the result: `14`

This sets the kth bit in the binary representation of n.
