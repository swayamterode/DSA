# Remove the last set bit (rightmost)

Given a number `N`, the task is to unset the rightmost set bit of the number.

## Example

```bash
Input : n = 7
Output : 6

Input : n = 12
Output : 8
```

Explanation: The binary representation of `7` is `111` and the binary representation of `6` is `110`. The rightmost set bit in `7` is at position `0`. So, unsetting it will give `6`.

## Approach

1. We know how to convert a number into binary.
2. To unset the rightmost set bit, we need to `AND` the number with `N-1`.

## Implementation

```cpp
int unsetRightmostSetBit(int N) {
    return (N & (N - 1));
}
```

Confused? Let's dry run the above code with an example.

## Dry Run

**Example 1:**

Given `N = 7`

```bash
N = 7 = 111
N - 1 = 6 = 110
```

Now, we will `AND` the above two values

```bash filename="dry-run.txt"
  111
& 110
------
  110
```

**Example 2:**

Given `N = 12`

```bash
N = 12 = 1100
N - 1 = 11 = 1011
```

```bash filename="dry-run.txt"
  1100
& 1011
------
  1000
```
